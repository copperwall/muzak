muzak
=====

muzak is an attempt at a metamusic player.

It indexes a filesystem tree, providing metadata to a user's preferred media
player. It also provides a pseudo-shell for controlling the indexed files
and the state of the player.

### TODO

* current indexing logic is terrible
* album art logic for `mpv` is funky
* all the documentation
* readline's tab complete is terrible with spaces
